Two types of variants are distinguished: 'additional text' and 'secondary text'. 'Additional text' refers to a line that appears in a minority of sources (often in only one). 'Secondary text' refers to variant words or variant lines that are found in a minority of sources. The function `remove_extra()` may remove the words of 'secondary text' and/or 'additional text' before the text is parsed by ElementTree. \n",

The DOTALL flag (in re.DOTALL) allows the search in the regular expression to continue over multiple lines. Note that the function does not simply erase everything between the `<addSpan >` and the `<anchor >` tags identified with the regular expression. Instead, it indentifies words and lines between those tags, and elimibates those. This is the case because on occasion there may be tags that begin before the `<addSpan>` tag and end with the secondary region. Erasing the whole region would invalidate the XML structure and make it impossible to scan the data with ElementTree.\n",

    "\n",
    "A word in the ETCSL files is represented by a number of nodes in the XML tree that identify the form (transliteration), citation form, guide word, part of speech, etc. The function `getword()` formats the word as closely as possible to the ORACC conventions. Three different types of words are treated in three different ways: Proper Nouns, Sumerian words and Emesal words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ETCSL **proper nouns** are nouns, which are qualified by a 'type' (Divine Name, Personal Name, Geographical Name, etc.; abbreviated as DN, PN, GN, etc.). In ORACC a word has a single POS; for proper nouns this is DN, PN, GN, etc. - so what is 'type' in ETCSL becomes POS in ORACC. ORACC proper nouns usually do not have a guide word (only a number to enable disambiguation of namesakes). The ETCSL guide words ('label') for names come pretty close to ORACC citation forms. Names are therefore formatted differently from other nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sumerian words** are treated in basically the same way in ETCSL and ORACC, but the citation forms and guide words are often different. Transformation of citation forms and guide words to ORACC (epsd2) standards takes place in the Notebook ETCSL-toEPSD2. This harmonization process uses a set of dictionaries (prepared by Niek Veldhuis and Terri Tanaka) that record ETCSL to EPSD2 equivalencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emesal words** in ETCSL use their Sumerian equivalents as citation form ('lemma'), adding a separate node ('emesal') for the Emesal form proper. This Emesal form is the one that is used as citation form in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guide words need removal of commas and spaces. Removal of commas will allow the output files to be read as Comma Separated Value (csv) files, which is an efficient input format for processes in Python and R. In the output file commas separate different fields from each other (text ID, text name, line number and text). Spaces need to be removed because standard tokenizers will understand spaces as word dividers. "

In the edition of the proverbs the same mechanism is used to distinguish between numerous tablets (often lentils) that contain just one proverb, or a few, and are collected in the files \"Proverbs from Susa,\" \"Proverbs from Nibru,\" etc. (ETCSL c.6.2.1 - c.6.2.5).\n",

The function checks to see if versions are available in the file that is being parsed. If so, the function iterates over these versions while adding the version name to the variable `line_prefix`. If there are no versions, the version name is left empty. The parsing process is continued by calling `getsection()` to see if the composition/version is further divided into sections."

For each such number the corresponding xml file is opened and the content of the file is sent to the function `parsetext()`. `Parsetext()` returns the variabe `parsed` which is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a single word in a single composition. The `parsed` is added to the list `alltexts`. In the end, `alltexts` will be a list of dictionaries that represent all the words in [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/). The list is transformed into a Pandas DataFrame. All missing values (`NaN`) are replaced by empty strings. The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file named `alltexts.csv` in the directory `output`."
